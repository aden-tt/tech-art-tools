- **Unity** – Shaders, tools, plugins, editor/runtime scripts, UPM-ready packages.
- **Unreal** – Plugins, shaders, utilities, Python/Blueprint scripts.
- **Godot** – Add-ons, scripts, and example projects.

### DCC (Digital Content Creation)
- **Maya** – Python/MEL scripts, shelves, plugins, modules.
- **Blender** – Add-ons, scripts, and startup tools.

### Examples
- Minimal demo projects and scenes showing how to use the assets.
