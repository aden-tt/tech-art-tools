Tools, shaders, plugins, and scripts for game development and technical art.  
Includes resources for real-time engines (Unity, Unreal) and DCC applications (Maya, Blender, Houdini, and more).

## Contents

### Engines
- **Unity** – Shaders, tools, plugins, editor/runtime scripts, UPM-ready packages.
- **Unreal** – Plugins, shaders, utilities, Python/Blueprint scripts.
- **Godot** – Add-ons, scripts, and example projects.

### DCC (Digital Content Creation)
- **Maya** – Python/MEL scripts, shelves, plugins, modules.
- **Blender** – Add-ons, scripts, and startup tools.
- **Houdini** – Digital assets (OTLs), shelf tools, packages.
- **Substance Designer** – Custom functions, graphs, plugins.
- **Photoshop / After Effects** – Scripts and plugins.

### Common
- Engine-agnostic or DCC-agnostic libraries (math, color, I/O, profiling).

### Examples
- Minimal demo projects and scenes showing how to use the assets.
